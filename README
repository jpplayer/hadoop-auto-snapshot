hdfs-auto-snapshot:

Automatically create, rotate, and destroy periodic HDFS snapshots. This is
the utility that creates the @hdfs-auto-snap_frequent, @hdfs-auto-snap_hourly,
@hdfs-auto-snap_daily, @hdfs-auto-snap_weekly, and @hdfs-auto-snap_monthly
snapshots if it is installed.

It was originally forked from the zfs-auto-snapshot implementation: https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs-auto-snapshot.
