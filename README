hdfs-auto-snapshot:

Automatically create, rotate, and destroy periodic HDFS snapshots. This is
the utility that creates the @hdfs-auto-snap_frequent, @hdfs-auto-snap_hourly,
@hdfs-auto-snap_daily, @hdfs-auto-snap_weekly, and @hdfs-auto-snap_monthly
snapshots if it is installed.

It was originally forked from the zfs-auto-snapshot implementation: https://github.com/zfsonlinux/zfs-auto-snapshot.

Defaults:

Snapshot every 15 mn, keep 4
Snapshot every hour, keep 24
Snapshot every day, keep 31
Snapshot every week, keep 8
Snapshot every month, keep 12

Installation

git clone https://github.com/jpplayer/hdfs-auto-snapshot && cd hdfs-auto-snapshot && make install

Tips

Create Snapshotable directories in HDFS to use this software. For example, to snapshot your entire hadoop cluster: 
su hdfs -c 'hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /'
